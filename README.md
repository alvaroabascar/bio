###General Bioinformatics Module
This is a general bioinformatics Python module in progress. Whilst all core functions should work as intended, they are not neccessarily optimised. Redevelopment to resolve this is ongoing but irregular.

####biocore.py
All completed functions are located here. This file should be considered the most up-to-date and complete version of the module.

####Additional .py files
Active function development takes place in files additional to biocore.py. Any functions found outside of biocore.py should be considered as under development and may not accurately return their intended results.
