###General Bioinformatics Module
This is a general bioinformatics Python 3 module in progress. Whilst all functions are functional, they are not neccessarily optimal. Redevelopment to resolve this is ongoing but irregular.

####biocore.py
All completed functions are located here. This file should be considered the most up-to-date and complete version of the module.

####Additional .py files
Active function development takes place in files additional to biocore.py. Any functions found outside of biocore.py should be considered to be in partial development and may not accurately return their intended results.
